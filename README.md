# Terminal themed Website

My personal website, designed around the theme of a computer terminal. When I first made it it was a great challenge to improve my javascript and frontend skills, and it has been great to have a platform to upload some writeups on my projects to. Feel free to use this as a base to make your own personal website (free hosting with vercel!). Would love to hear any feedback or ideas for the site.
